## Overview

With our environments configured and secrets created, it's time to dive into the Terraform code that defines the DevSecOps pipeline infrastructure. This guide provides a detailed explanation of the critical components so you can fully understand how the system works.

## Code Overview

All relevant code is located in the `terraform` folder, which contains multiple Terraform modules:

1. **Core Infrastructure**
2. **CI/CD Pipelines**

### Core Infrastructure

This module provisions foundational infrastructure components such as storage, artifact registry, and secret management. It ensures that essential resources are available for secure DevSecOps operations.

- **Files**:
  - `main.tf`: Defines storage buckets, artifact registries, and secret management resources.
  - `variables.tf`: Configures input variables, including project ID and region.
  - `provider.tf`: Configures the Google Cloud provider settings.

### CI/CD Pipelines

This module sets up Cloud Build pipelines, IAM roles, and GitHub integration for CI/CD automation. Below are the key elements explained in detail:

#### Artifact Registry Configuration

- **Resource**: `google_artifact_registry_repository`
- **Purpose**:
  - Provisions a **Docker artifact repository** for storing container images.
  - Ensures that all built images are stored securely and version-controlled.
  - Enables seamless integration with Google Cloud Build for CI/CD pipelines.

#### Cloud Storage Bucket Configuration

- **Resource**: `google_storage_bucket`
- **Purpose**:
  - Provisions a Cloud Storage bucket for storing Cloud Build artifacts.
  - Standardizes bucket naming conventions using variables.
  - Ensures secure and centralized storage for build and deployment artifacts.

#### Secret Management Configuration

- **Resource**: `google_secret_manager_secret`
- **Purpose**:
  - Stores sensitive information such as API tokens securely.
  - Manages access control for secrets using IAM policies.
  - Ensures integration with Cloud Build and other services.

#### FastAPI Pipeline Configuration

- **Module**: `gcp_python_fastapi_pipeline`
- **Purpose**:
  - Establishes a CI/CD pipeline for the "GCP FastAPI" project.
  - Leverages the GitHub connection to pull source code from the repository.
  - Integrates the pipeline with the Cloud Storage bucket and Artifact Registry for seamless deployments.

#### Key Pipeline Parameters

- **GitHub Integration**:
  - Dynamically links the GitHub connection to Cloud Build triggers.
  - Configures repository details:
    - Repository: `The-DevSec-Blueprint/gcp-python-fastapi`
    - Branch: `main`
- **Build and Deployment**:
  - Buildspec: Located at `cloudbuild.yaml`.
  - Build environment:
    - Machine type: `E2_SMALL`
    - Image: `gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud`
    - Privileged mode enabled for containerized builds.
- **Security Scanning**:
  - Integrates **Snyk** for container security scanning.
  - Uses `SNYK_TOKEN` and `project_id` variables for authentication.

By understanding the purpose and structure of these Terraform configurations, you'll have a clearer picture of how the DevSecOps pipeline functions, from provisioning infrastructure to enabling secure and automated CI/CD workflows.
